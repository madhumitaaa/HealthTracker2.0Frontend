## 🎓 INTERVIEW SCRIPT

"I redesigned this health tracker frontend with a professional color system using Indigo and Teal to replace the original light blue. The dashboard features 6 color-coded health metrics that are both visually appealing and semantically meaningful. I improved the sidebar navigation from emoji-only labels to proper icon-plus-text styling, and enhanced all forms with better accessibility. The design demonstrates modern SaaS principles with smooth animations, proper elevation hierarchy, and responsive layouts that work on all device sizes. All features are fully functional with automatic demo mode fallback for offline testing, making it production-ready."
