## 💡 Interview Talking Points

1. **Professional Design**: "I implemented a custom color system with Indigo/Teal palette using CSS variables for consistency"

2. **Component Architecture**: "Organized into reusable components (Button, ErrorBanner, Loader) with clear separation of concerns"

3. **State Management**: "Used React Context API for authentication with token-based security and protected routes"

4. **Responsive Design**: "Mobile-first approach with responsive grid layouts working on all screen sizes"

5. **Error Handling**: "Implemented demo mode fallback for offline testing - all features work without a backend"

6. **Accessibility**: "Built with WCAG compliance, proper contrast ratios, keyboard navigation, and ARIA labels"

7. **Animations**: "Added smooth transitions, hover effects, and micro-interactions for professional UX"

8. **Demo Data**: "Each page shows realistic sample data, making the product fully demonstrable without backend"

---

## 📱 Responsive Breakpoints

- **Mobile**: < 768px (vertical layout)
- **Tablet**: 768px - 1024px (adjusted spacing)
- **Desktop**: > 1024px (full sidebar + content)

All components test perfectly on each size!

## 🔐 Security
